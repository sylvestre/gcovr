Description: Manages the compilation of coverage information from gcov
 The gcovr command provides a utility for running the gcov command and
 summarizing code coverage results. This command is inspired by the
 Python coverage.py package, which provides a similar utility in
 Python. Further, gcovr can be viewed as a command-line alternative of
 the lcov utility, which runs gcov and generates an HTML output.
