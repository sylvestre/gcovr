.SH NAME
gcovr \- generate simple coverage reports
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gcovr
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A utility to run gcov and generate a simple report that summarizes the
coverage
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number, then exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print progress messages
.TP
\fB\-\-object\-directory\fR=\fIOBJDIR\fR
Specify the directory that contains the gcov data
files.  gcovr must be able to identify the path
between the *.gcda files and the directory where gcc
was originally run.  Normally, gcovr can guess
correctly.  This option overrides gcovr's normal path
detection and can specify either the path from gcc to
the gcda file (i.e. what was passed to gcc's '\-o'
option), or the path from the gcda file to gcc's
original working directory.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR OUTPUT, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIOUTPUT\fR
Print output to this filename
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\fR
Keep the temporary *.gcov files generated by gcov.  By
default, these are deleted.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR
Delete the coverage files after they are processed.
These are generated by the users's program, and by
default gcovr does not remove these files.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR FILTER, \fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIFILTER\fR
Keep only the data files that match this regular
expression
.TP
\fB\-e\fR EXCLUDE, \fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fIEXCLUDE\fR
Exclude data files that match this regular expression
.TP
\fB\-\-gcov\-filter\fR=\fIGCOV_FILTER\fR
Keep only gcov data files that match this regular
expression
.TP
\fB\-\-gcov\-exclude\fR=\fIGCOV_EXCLUDE\fR
Exclude gcov data files that match this regular
expression
.TP
\fB\-r\fR ROOT, \fB\-\-root\fR=\fIROOT\fR
Defines the root directory for source files.  This is
also used to filter the files, and to standardize the
output.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xml\fR
Generate XML instead of the normal tabular output.
.TP
\fB\-\-xml\-pretty\fR
Generate pretty XML instead of the normal dense
format.
.TP
\fB\-\-html\fR
Generate HTML instead of the normal tabular output.
.TP
\fB\-\-html\-details\fR
Generate HTML output for source file coverage.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-branches\fR
Tabulate the branch coverage instead of the line
coverage.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-uncovered\fR
Sort entries by increasing number of uncovered lines.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-percentage\fR
Sort entries by decreasing percentage of covered
lines.
.TP
\fB\-\-gcov\-executable\fR=\fIGCOV_CMD\fR
Defines the name/path to the gcov executable [defaults
to the GCOV environment variable, if present; else
\&'gcov'].
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-unreachable\-branches\fR
Exclude from coverage branches which are marked to be
excluded by LCOV/GCOV markers or are determined to be
from lines containing only compiler\-generated "dead"
code.
